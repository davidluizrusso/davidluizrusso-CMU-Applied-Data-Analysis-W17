  + a. Set up data
```{r}
set.seed(1)
x1 <- runif(100)
x2 <- 0.5*x1 + rnorm(100)/10
y <- 2 + 2*x1 + 0.3*x2 + rnorm(100)
```

The form of the linear model is $y = 2 + 2x1 + 0.3x2 + \epsilon$.

The coefficients are $\beta_{0} = 2, \beta_{1} = 2, \beta_{2} = 0.3$

  + b. cor() and pairs()
```{r}
cor(x1, x2)
pairs(data.frame(x1 = x1, x2 = x2, y = y))
```

The correlation between x1 and x2 is 0.8351.

  + c. lm() and summary()
```{r}
lm1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
summary(lm1)
```
